=========================
This is a temporary GitHub version of Sturtevant's grid path finding benchmark.  You can find the original repository here:

N. Sturtevant. (2012) "[Benchmarks for Grid-Based Path Finding](http://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/)" Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games

In addition to the original map data, this repository also contains a JSON file with meta data listing all the maps and their scenarios for test data.

This code is free to use for research purposes
